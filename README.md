# What is irsdkWrapper?
irsdkWrapper is wrapper for the [irsdkSharp](https://github.com/SlevinthHeaven/irsdkSharp) repository with serialization.
This is an alternative to [iRacingSdkWrapper](https://github.com/NickThissen/iRacingSdkWrapper) with the goal to make it use less resources and have the latest telemetry data.
